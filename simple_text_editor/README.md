# Overview

This program works as a simple text editor

Mostly, this exists in order for me to mess around with java as a language and see the things that it can do, especially dealing with 
files.

# Development Environment

This was built in vscode with the help of their java extensions, which automatically created most of the folders here, the json, as well as the initial app.
